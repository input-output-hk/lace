description: ⚡ Execute parallel or sequential phases based on plan structure
argument-hint: [plan-path]

Execute plan: <plan>$ARGUMENTS</plan>

**IMPORTANT:** Activate needed skills. Ensure token efficiency. Sacrifice grammar for concision.

## Workflow

### 1. Plan Analysis
- Read `plan.md` from given path
- **Check for:** Dependency graph, Execution strategy, Parallelization Info, File Ownership matrix
- **Decision:** IF parallel-executable → Step 2A, ELSE → Step 2B

### 2A. Parallel Execution
1. Parse execution strategy (which phases concurrent/sequential, file ownership)
2. Launch multiple `fullstack-developer` agents simultaneously for parallel phases
   - Pass: phase file path, environment info, file ownership boundaries
3. Wait for parallel group completion, verify no conflicts
4. Execute sequential phases (one agent per phase after dependencies)
5. Proceed to Step 3

### 2B. Sequential Execution
Follow `./.claude/workflows/primary-workflow.md`:
1. Use main agent step by step
2. Read `plan.md`, implement phases one by one
3. Use `project-manager` for progress updates
4. Use `ui-ux-designer` for frontend
5. Run type checking after each phase
6. Proceed to Step 3

### 3. Testing
- Use `tester` for full suite (NO fake data/mocks)
- If fail: `debugger` → fix → repeat

### 4. Code Review
- Use `code-reviewer` for all changes
- If critical: fix → retest

### 5. Project Management & Docs
- If approved: `project-manager` + `docs-manager` in parallel (update plans, docs, roadmap)
- If rejected: fix → repeat

### 6. Onboarding
- Guide user step by step (1 question at a time)

### 7. Final Report
- Summary, guide, next steps
- Ask to commit (use `git-manager` if yes)

**Examples:**
- Parallel: "Phases 1-3 parallel, then 4" → Launch 3 agents → Wait → Launch 1 agent
- Sequential: "Phase 1 → 2 → 3" → Main agent implements each phase
