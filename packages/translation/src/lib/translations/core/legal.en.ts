    compromised if customers choose to store their private keys in non-secure systems, such as third-party email
    services, which may be susceptible to security breaches and security incidents, despite our efforts to
    discourage our customers from engaging in these practices. Although such incidents are outside of our

    nevertheless blame or become dissatisfied with the Software as a result of these negative experiences.

      10. Dispute Resolution.
      <i>
        Please read this Section 10 (the "Arbitration Agreement") carefully. It requires you to arbitrate
        disputes with IOG and limits the manner in which you can seek relief.
      </i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.1. Initial Dispute.</b>
    If you have a dispute with IOG, you agree to contact IOG using the form <contactform href="https://iohk.io/en/contact" target="_blank">here</contactform> (note that this website may be
    subject to different terms of use) to attempt to resolve the issue informally before any other method of
    dispute resolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.2. Applicability of Arbitration.</b>
    After following step 10.1 above, you agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or
    use of the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with IOG, will be resolved by binding
    arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your
    claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class,
    non-representative) basis; and (2) you or IOG may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other
    misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets,
    copyrights, and patents).
    <b>
      This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted
      before the Effective Date of these Terms or any prior version of these Terms.
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH IOG, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK
      TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST IOG ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR
      REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF. INSTEAD, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST IOG IN AN INDIVIDUAL
      ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN
      ARBITRATOR. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING
      WHETHER TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.3. Arbitration Rules and Forum.</b>
    The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To
    begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim via
    certified mail, return receipt requested, to IOG Legal Department, 2015 Ionosphere Street #201, Longmont,
    Colorado, 80504. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution
    provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and
    interest, will be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures
    available at
    <rulesstreamlinedarbitration href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank">
      http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration
    </rulesstreamlinedarbitration>
    all other claims will be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
    Procedures, available at
    <rulescomprehensivearbitration href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/" target="_blank">
      http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.

    JAMS's rules are also available at
    <jamsadr href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">
      www.jamsadr.com
    </jamsadr>
    or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
    alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS's filing,
    administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, IOG will pay them for you.
    In addition, IOG will reimburse all such JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims
    totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, IOG will not
    seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in
    the Burrough of Manhattan, New York. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
    any court of competent jurisdiction. All arbitration pleadings and proceedings will be conducted in English.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.4. Authority of Arbitrator.</b>
    The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to (a)
    determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to
    the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but
    not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The
    arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and IOG. The arbitration proceeding will
    not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will
    have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will have the
    authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
    individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, the Terms and the Arbitration Agreement. The
    arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and
    conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator
    has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The
    award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.5. Waiver of Jury Trial.</b>
    YOU AND IOG HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT
    OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and IOG are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by
    arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 10.1 above. An arbitrator can
    award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a
    court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
    subject to very limited review.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.6. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</b>
    ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL
    BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR
    USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATE WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding anything
    to the contrary herein, (a) representative action for public injunctive relief may be arbitrated on a class
    basis and (b) in the event that the foregoing sentence is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a
    particular class or dispute for recovery of damages, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and
    instead claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 10.7.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.7. 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</b>
    You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to
    opt out to legal@iohk.io, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Notice
    must include your name and address and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration
    Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply
    to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you
    may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.8. Severability.</b>
    If any part of this Arbitration Agreement is found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such
    part will be of no force and effect and will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will
    continue in full force and effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.9. Survival of Agreement.</b>
    This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with IOG.

    <b>10.10. Modification.</b>
    Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if IOG makes any future
    material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had
    already provided notice of to IOG.

    any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Terms, IOG's dispatch
    of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to
