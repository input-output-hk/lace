Use `ai-multimodal` skills to describe super details of the video: be specific about describing every element, every interaction, every animation, every transition, every color, every font, every spacing, every size, every shape, every texture, every material, every light, every shadow, every reflection, every refraction, every blur, every glow, every reflection, every refraction, every blur, every glow, every reflection, every refraction, every blur, every glow, every image.
2. Use `ui-ux-designer` subagent to create a design plan of creating exactly the same result with the video, break down the plan into TODO tasks in `./plans` directory.
3. Then implement the plan step by step.
4. If user doesn't specify, create the design in pure HTML/CSS/JS.
5. Report back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, ask user to review the changes and approve them.
6. If user approves the changes, update the `./docs/design-guidelines.md` docs if needed.
