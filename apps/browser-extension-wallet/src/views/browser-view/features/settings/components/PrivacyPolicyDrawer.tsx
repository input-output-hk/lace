        <Title>3. Legal Basis under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          For a citizen or resident of a member country of the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA),
          the legal basis for collecting and using Personal Data described in this Privacy Policy depends on the
          Personal Data being collected and the specific context in which it is collected as described below:
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>OG may process your Personal Data because:</Paragraph>

        <ul>
          <li className={styles.settingsText}>IOG needs to perform a contract with you</li>
          <li className={styles.settingsText}>You have given us permission to do so</li>
          <li className={styles.settingsText}>The processing derives from IOG's legitimate interests</li>
          <li className={styles.settingsText}>IOG has to comply with applicable law</li>
        </ul>

        <Paragraph>
          The legal basis for IOG processing data about you is that such processing is necessary for the purposes of:
        </Paragraph>

        <ul>
          <li className={styles.settingsText}>
            IOG exercising its rights and performing its obligations in connection with any contract we make with you
            (Article 6 (1) (b) General Data Protection Regulation),
          </li>
          <li className={styles.settingsText}>
            Compliance with IOG's legal obligations (Article 6 (1) (c) General Data Protection Regulation), and/or
          </li>
          <li className={styles.settingsText}>
            Legitimate interests pursued by IOG (Article 6 (1) (f) General Data Protection Regulation).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Paragraph>
          Generally the legitimate interest pursued by IOG in relation to our use of your personal data is the efficient
          performance or management of our business relationship with you.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In some cases, we may ask if you consent to the relevant use of your personal data. In such cases, the legal
          basis for IOG processing that data about you may (in addition or instead) be that you have consented (Article
          6 (1) (a) General Data Protection Regulation).
        </Paragraph>
        <br />
        <br />

        <Title>4. Retention of Data</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          IOG will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy

          obligations (for example, if IOG is required to retain your Personal Data to comply with applicable laws),
          resolve disputes, and enforce legal agreements and policies.
        </Paragraph>
        <br />
        <br />
        <Paragraph>
          IOG will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter
          period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of
          the Product, or IOG is legally obligated to retain such data for longer time periods.
        </Paragraph>
        <br />
        <br />

        <Title>5. Transfer Of Data</Title>

          data on commission, based on standard EU contract stipulations.
        </Paragraph>

          Tag Manager only implements tags. This means that no cookies are set and no personal data is recorded. Google
          Tag Manager triggers other tags which, in turn, may record data. However, Google Tag Manager does not access
          this data. If tags have been disabled at the domain or cookie level, this remains in place for all tracking
          tags if these are implemented with Google Tag Manager. You can find out more about Google Tag Manager by

        <Paragraph>
          This website also uses the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to serve ads
          that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports, or to prevent a user from seeing the same
          ads multiple times. Google uses a cookie ID to determine which ads are running in which browser and can
          prevent them from being displayed multiple times. In addition, DoubleClick uses cookie IDs to track
          conversions related to ad requests. For example, if a user sees a DoubleClick ad and later goes to the
          advertiser's website with the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies
          do not contain personally identifiable information.

        <Paragraph>
          Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google

          Google and therefore inform you to the best of our knowledge: By including DoubleClick, Google receives the
          information that you access the corresponding part of our website or clicked an ad from us. If you are
          registered with a service provided by Google, Google may associate the visit with your account. Even if you

          party advertisements; b) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block
          cookies from the domain "www.googleadservices.com", https://www.google.com/settings/ads, this setting is
          deleted when you delete your cookies; c) by deactivating the interest-based advertisements of the providers
          that are part of the "About Ads" self-regulation campaign via the link http://www.aboutads.info/choices, this

          For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your

        </Paragraph>

          For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes
          aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest
          of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to
          Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.

          Newsletter tracking (also referred to as Web beacons or tracking pixels) is used if users have given their
          explicit prior consent. When the newsletter is dispatched, the external server can then record certain data
          related to the recipient, such as the time and date the newsletter is retrieved, the IP address or details
          regarding the email program (client) used. The name of the image file is personalized for every email
          recipient by a unique ID being appended to it. The sender of the email notes which ID belongs to which email
          address and is thus able to determine which newsletter recipient has just opened the email when the image is
          called.
