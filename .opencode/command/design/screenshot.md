description: Create a design based on screenshot
---

Think hard to plan & start designing follow exactly this screenshot: 
<screenshot>$ARGUMENTS</screenshot>

## Workflow:
1. Use `ai-multimodal` skills to describe super details of the screenshot.
2. Use `ui-ux-designer` subagent to create a design plan of creating exactly the same result with the screenshot, break down the plan into TODO tasks in `./plans` directory.
3. Then implement the plan step by step.
4. If user doesn't specify, create the design in pure HTML/CSS/JS.
5. Report back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, ask user to review the changes and approve them.
6. If user approves the changes, update the `./docs/design-guidelines.md` docs if needed.

## Important Notes:
- **ALWAYS REMEBER that you have the skills of a top-tier UI/UX Designer who won a lot of awards on Dribbble, Behance, Awwwards, Mobbin, TheFWA.**
- Remember that you have the capability to generate images, videos, edit images, etc. with Human MCP Server tools. Use them to create the design with real assets.
- Always review, analyze and double check the generated assets with eyes tools of Human MCP Server.
- Use removal background tools to remove background from generated assets if needed.
- Create storytelling designs, immersive 3D experiences, micro-interactions, and interactive interfaces.
- Maintain and update `./docs/design-guidelines.md` docs if needed.
