description: ⚡⚡⚡ Create detailed plan with parallel-executable phases
argument-hint: [task]
---

Think strategically about parallelization.
Activate `planning` skill.

## Your mission
<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

## Workflow
1. Create a directory named `plans/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-plan-name` (eg. `plans/20251101-1505-authentication-and-profile-implementation`).
   Make sure you pass the directory path to every subagent during the process.
2. Follow strictly to the "Plan Creation & Organization" rules of `planning` skill.
3. Use multiple `researcher` agents (max 2 agents) in parallel to research for this task:
   Each agent research for a different aspect of the task and are allowed to perform max 5 tool calls.
4. Analyze the codebase by reading `codebase-summary.md`, `code-standards.md`, `system-architecture.md` and `project-overview-pdr.md` file.
   **ONLY PERFORM THIS FOLLOWING STEP IF `codebase-summary.md` is not available or older than 3 days**: Use `/scout <instructions>` slash command to search the codebase for files needed to complete the task.
5. Main agent gathers all research and scout report filepaths, and pass them to `planner` subagent with the prompt to create a parallel-optimized implementation plan.
6. Main agent receives the implementation plan from `planner` subagent, and ask user to review the plan

## Special Requirements for Parallel Execution

**CRITICAL:** The planner subagent must create phases that:
1. **Can be executed independently** - Each phase should be self-contained with no runtime dependencies on other phases
2. **Have clear boundaries** - No file overlap between phases (each file should only be modified in ONE phase)
3. **Separate concerns logically** - Group by architectural layer, feature domain, or technology stack
4. **Minimize coupling** - Phases should communicate through well-defined interfaces only
5. **Include dependency matrix** - Clearly document which phases must run sequentially vs in parallel

**Parallelization Strategy:**
- Group frontend/backend/database work into separate phases when possible
- Separate infrastructure setup from application logic
- Isolate different feature domains (e.g., auth vs profile vs payments)
- Split by file type/directory (e.g., components vs services vs models)
- Create independent test phases per module

**Phase Organization Example:**
```
Phase 01: Database Schema (can run independently)
Phase 02: Backend API Layer (can run independently)
Phase 03: Frontend Components (can run independently)
Phase 04: Integration Tests (depends on 01, 02, 03)
```

## Output Requirements

**Plan Directory Structure**
```
plans/
└── YYYYMMDD-HHmm-plan-name/
    ├── research/
    │   ├── researcher-XX-report.md
    │   └── ...
    ├── reports/
    │   ├── XX-report.md
    │   └── ...
    ├── scout/
    │   ├── scout-XX-report.md
    │   └── ...
    ├── plan.md
    ├── phase-XX-phase-name-here.md
    └── ...
```

**Research Output Requirements**
- Ensure every research markdown report remains concise (≤150 lines) while covering all requested topics and citations.

**Plan File Specification**
- Save the overview access point at `plans/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-plan-name/plan.md`. Keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each implementation phase with status, progress, parallelization group, and links to phase files.
- For each phase, create `plans/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-plan-name/phase-XX-phase-name-here.md` containing the following sections in order:
  - Context links (reference parent plan, dependencies, docs)
  - **Parallelization Info** (which phases can run concurrently, which must wait)
  - Overview (date, description, priority, implementation status, review status)
  - Key Insights
  - Requirements
  - Architecture
  - **Related code files** (MUST be exclusive to this phase - no overlap with other phases)
  - **File Ownership** (explicit list of files this phase owns/modifies)
  - Implementation Steps
  - Todo list
  - Success Criteria
  - **Conflict Prevention** (how this phase avoids conflicts with parallel phases)
  - Risk Assessment
  - Security Considerations
  - Next steps

**Main plan.md must include:**
- Dependency graph showing which phases can run in parallel
- Execution strategy (e.g., "Phases 1-3 parallel, then Phase 4")
- File ownership matrix (which phase owns which files)

## Important Notes
**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
**IMPORTANT:** Do not start implementing.
**IMPORTANT:** Each phase MUST have exclusive file ownership - no file can be modified by multiple phases.
