description: Create immersive interactive 3D designs with Three.js
---

Think hard to plan & start working on these tasks follow the Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team and Development Rules:
<tasks>$ARGUMENTS</tasks>

## Workflow:
1. Use `ui-ux-designer` subagent and `researcher` subagent to create a comprehensive 3D design plan with TODO tasks in `./plans` directory.
2. Then use `ui-ux-designer` subagent to implement the plan step by step.
3. Create immersive 3D experiences using Three.js with particle effects, custom shaders, and interactive elements.
4. Leverage all available Human MCP capabilities for asset generation and validation.
5. Report back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, ask user to review the changes and approve them.
6. If user approves the changes, update the `./docs/design-guidelines.md` docs if needed.

## 3D Design Requirements:
- Implement Three.js scenes with proper optimization
- Create custom GLSL shaders for unique visual effects
- Design GPU-accelerated particle systems
- Add immersive camera controls and cinematic effects
- Implement post-processing effects and render pipelines
- Ensure responsive behavior across all devices
- Optimize performance for real-time rendering
- Add interactive elements and smooth animations

## Human MCP Tools Integration:

### ai-multimodal Skills & ImageMagick Skill (Asset Generation & Processing):
- Generate textures, skyboxes, and environment maps with ai-multimodal skills
- Create custom particle sprites and effect assets via ai-multimodal prompts
- Generate 3D object textures with specific styles using ai-multimodal skills
- Create video backgrounds for immersive scenes with ai-multimodal capabilities
- Apply camera movements, inpainting, and outpainting through ai-multimodal skills
- Refine, batch edit, and optimize outputs with imagemagick skill workflows

### JIMP Tools (Image Processing):
- Process and optimize textures for WebGL
- Create normal maps and height maps from images
- Generate sprite sheets for particle systems
- Remove backgrounds for transparent textures
- Resize and optimize assets for performance
- Apply masks for complex texture effects

### Eyes Tools (Visual Analysis):
- Analyze reference images for 3D scene composition
- Compare design mockups with implementation
- Validate texture quality and visual consistency
- Extract color palettes from reference materials
- Verify shader effects and visual output

## Implementation Stack:
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- GLSL for custom vertex and fragment shaders
- HTML/CSS/JS for UI integration
- WebGL for GPU-accelerated graphics
- Post-processing libraries for effects

## Notes:
- Remember that you have the capability to generate images, videos, edit images, etc. with ai-multimodal skills. Use them extensively to create realistic 3D assets.
- Always review, analyze and double check generated assets with eyes tools of Human MCP Server.
- Leverage ai-multimodal skills and imagemagick skill to create custom textures, particle sprites, environment maps, and visual effects.
- Use imagemagick skill to process and optimize all visual assets for WebGL performance.
- Test 3D scenes across different devices and optimize for smooth 60fps performance.
- Maintain and update `./docs/design-guidelines.md` docs with 3D design patterns and shader libraries.
- Document shader code, particle systems, and reusable 3D components for future reference.
