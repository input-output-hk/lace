# Setting up local connection with DApp Radar API

DApp Explorer uses [DApp Radar API](https://apis-portal.dappradar.com/full-api-reference)
as a data source.
For the local development you need to set up your personal
[subscription](https://apis-portal.dappradar.com/subscriptions) to obtain an api token.
You can use a free plan allowing you to perform 100 api calls per month.

Once you have your personal api token set it in your `.env` file
under the `DAPP_RADAR_API_KEY` name.
