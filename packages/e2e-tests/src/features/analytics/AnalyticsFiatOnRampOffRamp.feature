  Scenario: Fiat On & Off Ramp - Banxa - event tracking
    Given I switch network to: "Mainnet" in extended mode
    When I navigate to Tokens extended page
    And I set up request interception for posthog analytics request(s)
    And I click on "Buy ADA" button on Banxa's widget
    Then I validate latest analytics single event "token | tokens | top your wallet | buy ada | click"
    When I click on "Go Back" button on "You're leaving Lace for Banxa" dialog
    Then I validate latest analytics single event "token | buy ada | disclaimer | go back | click"
    When I click on "Buy ADA" button on Banxa's widget
    And I click on "Continue" button on "You're leaving Lace for Banxa" dialog
