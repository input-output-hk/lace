# Shared Wallet Schema Documentation

This directory contains JSON schemas and example files for the shared wallet structure based on CIP-1854.

## Schemas

### `shared-wallet-schema.json`
This schema defines the structure of a shared wallet. It includes metadata about the wallet and a reference to the native script. The metadata contains the shared wallet name and a list of participants, each with a name and an Ed25519KeyHash public key.

### `cardano-babbage.json`
This schema defines various types used in Cardano transactions, including definitions for native scripts, addresses, and other related types.

## Examples

### `shared-wallet-scriptAll-example.json`
This example demonstrates a shared wallet using the `ScriptAll` native script type, which requires all specified scripts to validate for the transaction to be considered valid.

### `shared-wallet-scriptAny-example.json`
This example demonstrates a shared wallet using the `ScriptAny` native script type, which requires at least one of the specified scripts to validate for the transaction to be considered valid.

### `shared-wallet-scriptNOfK-example.json`
This example demonstrates a shared wallet using the `ScriptNOfK` native script type, which requires a minimum number (`N`) of the specified scripts to validate for the transaction to be considered valid.

## Regenerating TypeScript Types

To regenerate the TypeScript types from the JSON schema, use the following command:

```bash
npx --package json-schema-to-typescript -c 'json2ts shared-wallet-schema.json > shared-wallet-types-autogenerated.ts'
