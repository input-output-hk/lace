# Contributing

1. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace-public-poc/issues) that would clearly define the problem you are trying to solve and link a pr as a proposed solution to it.
2. Ensure that your source branch is up-to-date with the main one, could be built and tested locally, and update proper configuration files with details of changes to the interface, such as added environment variables, changed API endpoints, etc.
3. Please follow the coding conventions that are mostly enforced by either the root-level TS or lint configs (try to avoid disabling such rules or provide a strong reason behind that).
4. Please keep in mind that it might take some time till your pr gets properly reviewed and be open for further discussions.

Please see [README.md](https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace-public-poc/blob/main/apps/browser-extension-wallet/README.md) for more info.
